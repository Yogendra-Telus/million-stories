              Welcome to Million Stories, a service dedicated to providing you with educational information and videos
              about financial literacy and entrepreneurship streamed over the internet via the Million Stories website
              (located at www.millionstories.com) and Million Stories authorized devices (collectively, the “Million

            <p>
              This Privacy Policy is to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and
              disclosure of Personal Information (as defined below) we receive when you visit and use the Services. As
              used in this Privacy Policy, the “Services” means the services provided by Million Stories for discovering
              and watching video programs, including all features and functionalities, the Million Stories User
              Interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with the services. This Privacy Policy applies
              only to information that you provide to us through the Services, and when you access or use any
              information, services, products or content offered by Million Stories through the Services. This Privacy
              Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new
              Privacy Policy on the Million Stories website. You should consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any
              changes.
            </p>

            <h5>The Information We Collect</h5>

            <p>
              In the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain information that could
              reasonably be used to contact you or identify you personally ("Personal Information"). Personal
              Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and postal address.
              Personal Information also includes your IP address or other unique identifier that is associated, on a
              persistent or on-going basis, with your computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you use
              to access the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some features on the Services may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally
              identifiable, such as city or state of residence, date of birth and gender. Such demographic information
              is referred to collectively, along with Usage Information (defined below), as “Non-Personal Information.”
              Non-Personal Information is generally non-identifying, but, if we associate it with you as an identifiable
              individual, we will treat it as Personal Information.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              When visitors use our Services, we and our third-party service providers also may automatically collect
              some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system you are using
              (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox),
              the domain name of the Internet service provider you are using (e.g., Verizon), and your activity while
              using our Services (e.g., which of our pages you have viewed, and the content viewed) (“Usage
              Information”).{' '}
            </p>

            <h5>Collection Methods/Tracking Technologies</h5>
            <p>
              In addition to the information that you may provide to us, our Services may use software technology such
              as "cookies," “flash cookies,” "web beacons," “embedded scripts” or other similar technologies
              (collectively referred to as "Tracking Technologies"). These Tracking Technologies are used to help tailor
              our content, allow visitors to move between associated websites without logging into each site, content
              protection and other purposes related to our management of the Services. Cookies are small text files
              stored locally on your Device that help store user preferences. Flash cookies are data files placed on
              your Device via the Adobe Flash plugin, which may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your computer or
              other device. Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, such as enabling a Flash feature and
              remembering your preferences. Web beacons or "clear gifs" are small pieces of code placed on websites used
              to collect advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses. An
              embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with
              the Services, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our
              web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Services, and
              is deactivated or deleted thereafter. We may use Tracking Technologies to determine how many visitors we
              have and how often they visit various sections of our Services and to improve or customize the content and
              offerings on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience through our
              Services, such as to recognize you by your user name and when you return to our Services, and save your
              password and password-protective areas. We, our third-party service providers and/or our partners may use
              Tracking Technologies to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to the Tracking Technologies, log data collected on our web servers supply us with aggregate
              Usage Information about the number of visits to different pages on our Services. We use such aggregate
              Usage Information to improve access to content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types
              to make our content available to as many users as possible.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to the use of Tracking Technologies as set forth in
              this Privacy Policy. You can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar
              technologies through your browser and can learn more about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers by
              visiting: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.
              Please be aware, however, that blocking cookies and other Tracking Technologies will affect your online
              experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered through our Services. Please know
              that certain areas and features of our Services can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies, Flash
              cookies, or other similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices may
              prevent you from accessing some of our content.

              websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do
              Not Track” means in this context. If you enable “Do Not Track” functionality on your browser, Google
              Analytics will not track your usage of our website. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit

            <h5>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h5>

            <p>
              Third Parties. We will not share or sell Personal Information with other organizations for their marketing
              or promotional uses without your express consent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Social Media. If you choose to link your Million Stories account with a social networking service (such
              as, for example, Facebook), Million Stories and that service may share certain information about you and
              your activities. You may choose to share information about your activities, including what you watch on
              Million Stories, with that social network’s users.

              Non-Personal Information and log data with third parties for industry analysis and demographic profiling.
              Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information. While we
              may use a variety of service providers to perform analytics services, some of these companies are members
              of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") or the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory
              Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit

              advertising and the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit
              http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an
              "opt-out" by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program.
            </p>

            <p>
              Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate the Services, to
              provide the Services on our behalf, to perform services related to administration of the Services
              (including, without limitation, maintenance, hosting and database management services, web analytics and
              administration). These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks
              on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. Million Stories cooperates with government and law enforcement
              officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about
              you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
              necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas),
              to protect the property and rights of Million Stories or a third party, to protect the safety of the
              public or any person, or to prevent or stop any activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of
              being, illegal, unethical, inappropriate or legally actionable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Business Transfers. Million Stories may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets,
              including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of

            </p>

            <p>
              California Residents. Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California residents who provide us
              with Personal Information in obtaining products or services for personal, family, or household use are
              entitled to request and obtain from us one time per calendar year information about the customer
              information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. Alternatively,
              the law provides that a company may comply, as Million Stories does, by disclosing in its privacy policy
              that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third
              parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that
              choice. As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Million Stories provides you choice prior to sharing your
              Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if
              you choose to opt-out at the time Million Stories offers that choice, Million Stories does not share your
              information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing
              information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice,
              please send your request to info@millionstories.com or to the following mailing address: 3900 Alameda
              Avenue, 11th Floor, Burbank, CA 90505. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the
              subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated
              mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We will respond to
              you at your mailing address, or at our option, your e-mail address. We are not responsible for notices
              that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.

              registration profile by logging into their account, going to the “My Account Info” page, clicking the
              “Edit Info” button, and changing the information associated with their account. If you completely delete
              all such information, your account may be deactivated. We will make good faith efforts to make the
              requested changes in our then active databases. If you make changes, information may persist internally
              for administrative purposes and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. We may
              also retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.{' '}
            </p>

            <h5>Security</h5>

            <p>
              We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort
              to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the
              information we collect online. However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission, or
              electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note that we cannot ensure
              or warrant the security of any information we collect. You use our Services and provide us with your
              information at your own risk.
            </p>

            <h5>Information Transfer</h5>

            <p>
              Your information may be transferred to -- and maintained on -- computers located outside of your state,
              province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as
              those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information
              to Million Stories, please be advised that we transfer Personal Information to the United States and
              process it there. The data protection and other laws of the United States or other countries in which your
              data may be stored or processed may not be as comprehensive as those in your own country. By using the
              Services, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to your information being transferred, processed,
              and stored as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>

            <p>
              The Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit a third party link such as a link to
              one of our Partners, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we call a third
              party a “Partner” or link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are
              affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security
              policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may
              place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from
              you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal
              Information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other
              websites you visit.

            <p>
              We process Personal Data for the purposes set out in the Privacy Policy. Our legal bases to process
              Personal Data include processing that is necessary to comply with legal requirements and to make mandatory
              disclosures to law enforcement and regulatory authorities; necessary for our legitimate interests (for

            <h5>EU DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h5>
            <p>
              The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws provide certain
              rights for individual data subjects ("EU Data Subject Rights"). You may decline to share certain Personal
              Data with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of our
              services. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the rights to access or rectify
              Personal Data, object to or restrict further processing, or request the erasure of Personal Data or, where
              feasible, to have it moved to a new service provider ("data portability"). You must be 16 years or older
              to make a request or else have your parent contact us on your behalf.
            </p>

              Normally, we can respond to requests for access within 48 hours. If we cannot honor your request
              concerning Data Subject Rights within 30 days, we will inform you and provide an explanation. When
              technically feasible, at your request, we will provide your Personal Data to you or transmit it directly
              to another controller.
            </p>
            <p>
              We retain your Personal Data while you have an account with us and while you are using our services or
              continuing to visit our Million Stories User Interfaces. We will retain your Personal Data for as long as
              it is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in the Privacy Policy, considering the time period
              reasonably necessary to: provide the services to you; exercise the choices and rights you have requested;
              comply with our contractual obligations; enforce our terms for use of the services; and comply with legal
              and regulatory requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us,
              you have the right to contact the relevant national data protection supervisory authority and lodge a

              We are a company based in the United States and Million Stories is intended only for viewers in the United

              technologies to access the Content from territories where Million Stories does not have rights or does not
              offer services is prohibited.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              Software and the transmission of applicable technical data, if any, in connection with the Million Stories

              12. ARBITRATION NOTICE: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW,
              YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND MILLION STORIES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL
              ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.
            </h5>

            <p>
              Except for disputes relating to the infringement or misappropriation of your or Million Stories’
              intellectual property (including but not limited to trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents and trade
              secrets) or disputes in which Million Stories is seeking an injunction (“Excluded Disputes”), you agree
              that all disputes between you and Million Stories (whether or not such dispute involves a third party)
              with regard to your relationship with Million Stories, including without limitation disputes related to
              these Terms of Use or your use of the Million Stories Services, will be resolved by binding, individual
              arbitration under the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services rules for arbitration of
              consumer-related disputes and you and Million Stories hereby expressly waive trial by jury. Neither you
              nor Million Stories will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by
              these Terms. At your election, desktop or telephone arbitration, if available, can be used for claims of
              less than $10,000. Rather than force everyone to visit us in Los Angeles, if you can demonstrate that
              arbitration in Los Angeles would create an undue burden to you, you are free to initiate the arbitration
              in your home city. Otherwise, the arbitration hearings will be held in Los Angeles County, California. As
              an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small
              claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Judgment on the award
              rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of
              applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or
              awards that conflict with these Terms of Use. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding
              except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act. You understand and agree that all aspects of the
              arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary in connection with
              a court application for a preliminary or permanent injunction, or unless otherwise required by law or
              judicial decision, shall be confidential. You understand and agree that any provision of applicable law
              notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award punitive or exemplary damages, except
              where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages. Judgment upon the
              award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any portion of
              this Section is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, for any reason, that portion shall be
              severed from the rest and shall not affect the agreement to resolve all controversies and claims through
              arbitration.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we always prefer to find ways to satisfy you as quickly and efficiently as possible, before
              initiating any arbitration proceeding, you agree to first discuss the matter informally with Million
              Stories for at least 30 days. To do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern
              and your proposed solution by mail to us at: Million Stories, 3900 Alameda Avenue, 11th Floor, Burbank, CA
              90505, Attn: Dispute Resolution.

            <h5>13. GOVERNING LAW: </h5>

            <p>
              These Terms of Use are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California
              without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. In the event of an Excluded Dispute, you agree to
              submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Los Angeles County of the State of
              California.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              Please note that these Terms of Use, including Million Stories Privacy Policy which is incorporated in
              these Terms, constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Million Stories and govern your use of
              the Million Stories Services (including your use of the Content) (but excludes any services, if any, that
              Million Stories may provide to you under a separate signed written agreement), and completely replaces any
              prior agreements between you and Million Stories in relation to the Million Stories Services. Except as
              set forth in Section 2 above, these Terms may not be amended or varied except in a writing signed by
              Million Stories. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of
              these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be
              deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
              provisions. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with the prior
              written consent of a duly authorized representative of Million Stories. No waiver by either party of any
              breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or
              default.
